# MultiSig Wallet Project

## Overview

The MultiSig Wallet is a smart contract that requires multiple signatures to approve a transaction before it is executed. This ensures that no single individual has complete control over the wallet, making it a more secure way to manage funds.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Owners:** The wallet supports multiple owners, all of whom must approve transactions.
- **Transaction Approval:** Transactions are only executed once the required number of signatures is obtained.
- **Security:** Provides enhanced security by requiring multiple approvals for each transaction.
- **Admin Functions:** Add or remove wallet owners, set the required number of approvals, and manage transactions.

## How it Works

1. **Create a Transaction:** Any wallet owner can create a transaction.
2. **Approve Transaction:** Once a transaction is created, it must be approved by the required number of owners.
3. **Execute Transaction:** Once the required number of approvals is met, the transaction can be executed by any owner.
4. **Transaction Status:** View the status of transactions, including pending, approved, and executed transactions.

## Installation

   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```

4. Compile and deploy the contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
   ```

## Usage

### Creating a Transaction

- Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the MultiSig Wallet.
- Click on "Create Transaction" and input the recipient address, amount, and transaction details.
- Submit the transaction for approval by other wallet owners.

### Approving a Transaction

- As an owner, navigate to the "Pending Transactions" section.
- Review the transaction details and approve or reject the transaction.

### Executing a Transaction

- Once the required number of approvals is met, any owner can execute the transaction to send funds.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity:** Smart contract development.
- **Hardhat:** Development environment for testing and deploying contracts.
- **React.js:** Front-end framework for user interface.
